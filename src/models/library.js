    description: 'Information might want to be free; but, why should we free it? We’ve got enough trouble keeping track of all the petabits that already run around untethered, and risk a computer counterrevolution if we let the situation get much crazier. Information architect Richard Saul Wurman swept the field clear in 1989 with his groundbreaking book that foresaw the problems of data clutter and proposed a radical new means of organizing and presenting knowledge humanistically; for the new century, he has revised it substantially as Information Anxiety 2. This book is sparklingly clear and readable--it’d better be, after all--and offers insight not only to designers, educators, and content developers, but also to anyone who needs to communicate effectively through dense clouds of facts. If Wurman occasionally indulges in New Age-y pop psychology, his analysis is never muddy, and the more hardheaded reader will forgive him soon enough. The discussion alternates between describing the deeply stressful task of absorbing poorly organized data and exploring solutions that require a bit of rethinking, but that reward such an investment with improved understanding and, maybe, a state change from information to wisdom. We could do worse--if we don’t pay attention to Wurman and his colleagues, we almost certainly will. --Rob Lightner',

    description: 'THE COMPUTER CONSULTANT’S GUIDE/ If you’re serious about striking out on your own as a computer consultant, you don’t need a pep talk. You need reliable, authoritative information that will prepare you for the realities of independent consulting. You need to meet experienced consultants who have learned from their own successes and failures and who can teach you what it takes to develop a consultant mentality, attract and hold clients, set realistic prices, collect your money, run a business on your own, avoid tax problems, and much more./ In this Second Edition of The Computer Consultant’s Guide, Janet Ruhl introduces you to more than 150 practicing computer consultants. In their own words, these professionals tell you how they feel about their work, what problems they commonly encounter, which real-world solutions worked for them, and which didn’t. You’ll even get to listen in on disagreements over touchy subjects such as when to discount rates and whether to insist on a written contract. You’ll hear both sides of every question and decide for yourself which approach is right for you./ The Computer Consultant’s Guide doesn’t stop there. In excerpts from in-depth interviews with leading consultants, Ruhl addresses a host of important issues that will affect your day-to-day life as a consultant and could make or break your future: insurance requirements, effective image building, marketing techniques that work, and managing the client relationship./ New information in this Second Edition includes tax requirements and standard business practices for Canadian, U.K., and European consultants; and new tips and tricks from working consultants as well as ideas on how to use the Internet and World Wide Web to support and enhance your business. This practical, down-to-earth handbook also includes updated resource lists, extensive up-to-date information based on Janet Ruhl’s popular Web-based Real Rate Survey, IRS rules for establishing independent contractor status, and the ICCA’s model consulting contract./ If you’re serious about becoming a computer consultant, or even if you’re just thinking about it, this book gives you a clear picture of what you’re up against, prepares you to meet the challenges of launching your business, and helps you avoid the common errors that most fledgling consultants make.

    description: 'Like the one-time bestseller Jonathan Livingston Seagull, The Alchemist presents a simple fable, based on simple truths and places it in a highly unique situation. And though we may sniff a bestselling formula, it is certainly not a new one: even the ancient tribal storytellers knew that this is the most successful method of entertaining an audience while slipping in a lesson or two. Brazilian storyteller Paulo Coehlo introduces Santiago, an Andalusian shepherd boy who one night dreams of a distant treasure in the Egyptian pyramids. And so he’s off: leaving Spain to literally follow his dream./ Along the way he meets many spiritual messengers, who come in unassuming forms such as a camel driver and a well-read Englishman. In one of the Englishman’s books, Santiago first learns about the alchemists--men who believed that if a metal were heated for many years, it would free itself of all its individual properties, and what was left would be the "Soul of the World." Of course he does eventually meet an alchemist, and the ensuing student-teacher relationship clarifies much of the boy’s misguided agenda, while also emboldening him to stay true to his dreams. "My heart is afraid that it will have to suffer," the boy confides to the alchemist one night as they look up at a moonless night./ "Tell your heart that the fear of suffering is worse than the suffering itself," the alchemist replies. "And that no heart has ever suffered when it goes in search of its dreams, because every second of the search is a second’s encounter with God and with eternity."--Gail Hudson/',

    description: 'This large book, written by a long-time Unix consultant and his staff, can serve as a fine in-house training guide and reference tool. By interspersing how-to information and reference tables with brief quizzes and exercises, the authors of Unix Made Easy make it more likely that readers will retain information. System administrators might want to think about giving or loaning this book to all Unix newbies under their care./ The guide opens with a quick tour of Unix that includes logging in, exploring directory structures, creating files, and other basic jobs. Then, the authors explain vi using conceptual drawings that are superior for a computer book. Unfortunately, Unix Made Easydoesn’t cover other editors as well, although it provides plenty of details on and excellent conceptual drawings of editing aids grep, sed, and awk./ The book’s final chapters teach individual tasks, such as printing, using online help, and using Motif. In the section about using the Internet, the exercises (such as using FTP to get a list of mailing lists) make the last part of this book as much a guide to the global network as a guide to Unix. Unix Made Easy covers only two Web browsers--Mosaic and Lynx--before wrapping up with an appetite-whetting taste of C and Korn shell programming and environment modification./',

    description: 'You loved the comic strip; now read the business advice./ Or should that be anti-business advice? Scott Adams provides the hapless victim of re-engineering, rightsizing and Total Quality Management some strategies for fighting back, er, coping. Forced to work long hours, with no hope of a raise? Adams offers tips on maintaining parity in compensation. Along the way, Adams explains what ISO 9000 really is and assesses the irresistibility of female engineers./ The breath-taking cynicism of the strip should prepare readers for the author’s no-holds-barred attack on management fads, large organizations, pointless bureaucracy and sadistic rule-makers who glory in control of office supplies. Readers of the on-line Dilbert Newsletter are familiar with the kind of e-mail Adams receives from his readers -- and may even have sent a few of those missives themselves. Along with illustrative strips, e-mail messages provide excruciating examples of corporate behavior which compel the reader to agree with Adams when he insists that "People are idiots"./ The final chapter offers a model for would-be successful businesses to follow: the OA5 model. It’s introduced with little fanfare, no outrageous promises and just the right amount of self-deprecation./',

A hilarious but frighteningly real look at geek life in the ‘90’s, Coupland’s book manifests a peculiar sense of how technology affects the human race and how it will continue to affect all of us. Microserfs is the hilarious journal of Dan, an ex-Microsoft programmer who, with his coder comrades, is on a quest to find purpose in life. This isn’t just fodder for techies. The thoughts and fears of the not-so-stereotypical characters are easy for any of us to relate to, and their witty conversations and quirky view of the world make this a surprisingly thought-provoking book./ / " ... just think about the way high-tech cultures purposefully protract out the adolescence of their employees well into their late 20s, if not their early 30s," muses one programmer.

From its early chapters about relational database theory to its superb coverage of transaction management, this book is informative and easy to follow./ The authors begin by explaining how to design efficient data structures, an important part of database management. From there, they discuss how to populate a database with pieces of data and then explain how to construct queries that extract needed information. Throughout, the text is filled with statements, code, and output--and even common SQL errors. You ought to be able to follow along on any ANSI SQL 92-compliant system as you read this book./ Later chapters cover reports, joins, views, subqueries, and security. The authors explain each from a practical point of view. A section on common business-database tasks (how to specify decimal precision, for example) confirms this point of view. A good glossary exists in the back of this book, and a comprehensive table documents the differences among Sybase, Microsoft, Informix, and Oracle SQL command sets. The companion CD-ROM contains the Sybase SQL Anywhere Studio software, which ordinarily requires a 15-megabyte download marathon. --David Wall/',

    description: 'Webmastering, though it’s fast retreating from the bleeding edge it once occupied, is one of the last jack-of-all-trades job descriptions. A good Webmaster has to know something (quite a bit, actually) about computer networking, telephone services, software, database design and administration, user administration, electronic money transactions, and tons more. The job is not just about knowing HTML and being familiar with some graphics software. In essence, that’s the point that Webmastering for Dummies drives home to its readers. This book doesn’t go into much detail on any aspect of the job of the Webmaster--particularly the more-or-less autonomous kind that doesn’t function as part of a larger corporate information-technology group--but it provides a good overview of the job, and a moderate amount of valuable information./ You’ll probably want to read this book, or at least its individual chapters, straight through in the way you would read a novel. The plot here isn’t much, but the authors like to describe their subjects in English, rather than with code examples or protocols you can follow on a keyboard. It’s good reading, though it’s sometimes muddled by digressions into Web sites with design budgets in excess of $500,000. People with budgets like that aren’t going to be reading Dummies books to figure out how to set up their sites. You won’t be disappointed if you’re starting from zero, but expect to do further research. --David Wall/ Topics covered: The varied skills that are part of the Webmaster’s trade, including goals assessment, content accumulation, e-commerce engineering, service-provider interaction, and coding with HTML./',

    description: 'The first thing users of the Linux operating system come face to face with is the shell. "Shell" is the UNIX term for a user interface to the system -- something that lets you communicate with the computer via the keyboard and display. Bash, the Free Software Foundation’s "Bourne Again Shell," is the default shell for Linux, the popular free UNIX-like operating system. It’s also a replacement for the standard UNIX Bourne shell, which serves both as a user interface and as a programming language. Like the FSF’s other tools, bash is more than a mere replacement: it extends the Bourne shell in many ways. Features include command line editing, key bindings, integrated programming features, command completion, control structures (especially the select construct, which enables you to create menus easily), and new ways to customize your environment./ Whether you want to use bash for its user interface or its programming features you will find Learning the bash Shell a valuable guide. The book covers all of bash’s features, both for interactive use and programming. If you are new to shell programming, Learning the bash Shell provides an excellent introduction, covering everything from the most basic to the most advanced features, like signal handling and command line processing. If you’ve been writing shell scripts for years, it offers a great way to find out what the new shell offers. The book is full of examples of shell commands and programs that are designed to be useful in your everyday life as a user, not just to illustrate the feature being explained. All of these examples are freely available to you online on the Internet./ This second edition covers all of the features of bash Version 2.0, while still applying to bash Version 1.x. New features include the addition of one-dimensional arrays, parameter expansion, and more pattern-matching operations. bash 2.0 provides even more conformity with POSIX.2 standards, and in POSIX.2 mode is completely POSIX.2 conformant. This second edition covers several new commands, security improvements, additions to ReadLine, improved configuration and installation, and an additional programming aid, the bash shell debugger./ With this book you’ll learn:/ /',

    description: 'In Chapter 6 of Information Architecture for the World Wide Web, the authors discuss the details of good search-engine design. In a bitingly humorous segment, they analyze a Web site’s search-page results: "Let’s say you’re interested in knowing what the New Jersey sales tax is.... So you go to the State of New Jersey web site and search on sales tax. The 20 results are scored at either 84% or 82% relevant. Why does each document receive only one of two scores?... And what the heck makes a document 2% more relevant than another?"/ With a swift and convincing stroke, the authors of Information Architecture for the World Wide Web tear down many entrenched ideas about Web design. Flashy animations are cool, they agree, as long as they don’t aggravate the viewer. Nifty clickable icons are nice, but are their meanings universal? Is the search engine providing results that are useful and relevant? This book acts as a mirror and with careful questioning causes the reader to think through all the elements and decisions required for well-crafted Web design. --Jennifer Buckendorff/',

    description: 'A breakup, divorce, or loss of a loved one isn’t just the end of your relationship with that person. It’s a continuation of every feeling of abandonment you’ve ever suffered. It’s the loss of a system of approval you’d come to depend on. The struggle, as Gray points out in Starting Over, isn’t just to find a new partner, but to get over those feelings of abandonment or loss or anger or whatever else gets dredged up by the end of a relationship./ Perhaps the book’s most crucial chapter posits that the best way to get over the loss of love is to focus on the "love" more than the "loss." That may seem impossible, especially if the bum took off with your best friend, your life savings, and your Lyle Lovett CDs, but Gray didn’t get to be a household name because the advice in his Venus and Mars books doesn’t work. Remembering only the bad parts, Gray says, leaves you with an important part of your emotional being closed to new business./ As for the Venus and Mars stuff, that comes in the second half of the book, when Gray looks at how men and women start new relationships from different points of view, with different priorities (a man might want to have fun with no strings attached; a woman might carry with her a lengthy list of requirements for her next partner, a list that excludes virtually all available men)./ If you’ve never read Gray’s work before, you have to be prepared to check your cynicism at the door. This is earnest stuff, but it’s also based on decades of experience counseling clients. He’s not one of those photogenic, nine-times-divorced shrinklets who’s telling you how to conduct your relationships without any real clue of what makes love last. This is the real package: nothing glib, nothing quick and easy, nothing you could’ve figured out from a "Love Is..." cartoon./',

    description: 'Danny Goodman felt that he couldn’t trust any of the documentation on Dynamic HTML (DHTML) that he read (too many contradictions), so he wrote this book as a reference for working with his own clients. After testing tags and techniques on multiple releases of the main browsers, Goodman came up with very practical information--some of which you may not find in any other resource./ Goodman assumes a solid foundation, if not expertise, in basic HTML and an understanding of what DHTML is all about. From those assumptions, he presents a meaty, information-dense volume. The first of the book’s four sections discusses industry standards and how to apply the basic principles of DHTML. He emphasizes the differences in Web browsers and discusses how to build pages so that they work well in both Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer. The second section is an extensive, quick reference of all the tags, objects, and properties of HTML, cascading style sheets, Document Object Model, and core JavaScript. A particularly handy cross-reference guide to this information follows, helping you locate it in alternate ways. The final section contains appendices, with useful tables of values and commands. --Elizabeth Lewis/',

    description: 'Stan Davis and Christopher Meyer look at how three factors in the wired world--speed, connectivity, and intangibles--are driving the increasing rate of change in the business marketplace. Citing examples that include Mercedes-Benz automobiles, Otis elevators, and even Amazon.com, Davis and Meyer interpret how development in these three areas is causing the boundaries of other formerly distinct categories to blur. Once business tended to be either products or services. But what about a box that tracks your car if stolen? You are buying a product--a piece of electronics--but are actually receiving a service--the ability to track a stolen automobile. The distinction between buyers and sellers is also blurring; for example, in grocery stores vendors buy shelf space from the retailer but also sell their products to the store. Even the distinction between work time and home time is blurring with the development of Internet-powered home offices, where time can be used more flexibly. According to Davis and Meyer, blur should be embraced because it will only increase. The authors wrap up with 50 ways to add productive blur to your business and 10 ways to adapt to blur in your personal life. --Elizabeth Lewis',

    description: 'Change can be a blessing or a curse, depending on your perspective. The message of Who Moved My Cheese? is that all can come to see it as a blessing, if they understand the nature of cheese and the role it plays in their lives. Who Moved My Cheese? is a parable that takes place in a maze. Four beings live in that maze: Sniff and Scurry are mice--nonanalytical and nonjudgmental, they just want cheese and are willing to do whatever it takes to get it. Hem and Haw are "littlepeople," mouse-size humans who have an entirely different relationship with cheese. It’s not just sustenance to them; it’s their self-image. Their lives and belief systems are built around the cheese they’ve found. Most of us reading the story will see the cheese as something related to our livelihoods--our jobs, our career paths, the industries we work in--although it can stand for anything, from health to relationships. The point of the story is that we have to be alert to changes in the cheese, and be prepared to go running off in search of new sources of cheese when the cheese we have runs out./ Dr.&#x00a0;Johnson, coauthor of The One Minute Manager and many other books, presents this parable to business, church groups, schools, military organizations--anyplace where you find people who may fear or resist change. And although more analytical and skeptical readers may find the tale a little too simplistic, its beauty is that it sums up all natural history in just 94 pages: Things change. They always have changed and always will change. And while there’s no single way to deal with change, the consequence of pretending change won’t happen is always the same: The cheese runs out. --Lou Schuler/',

The authors look at available XML tools (including freeware utilities and the Internet Explorer 5 beta) and XML basics, such as Document Type Definitions (DSDs), cascading style sheets (CSS), and Extensible Stylesheet Language (XSL). The authors also present real-world implementations of XML, including Microsoft’s Channel Definition Format and the Chemical Markup Language (for chemists)./ Next, the book moves on to the nitty-gritty of building XML documents, including design considerations, conventions, and using custom tags. Information on XML and databases follows, and then the authors highlight important XML topics, such as namespaces, XLinks and XPointers (for linking content), and the XML document object model./ Later sections of the book turn to practical XML samples. First, SQL Server 6.5 is used with an XML phone-list entry application. Another example for distributing technical papers shows off the potential of using XML to work with Internet agents. A third application uses Java and XML to automatically generate static HTML for slide photographs and descriptions, a timesaving idea for Webmasters./ The importance of XML is growing, and XML Applications provides URLs of Web sites that can provide more on emerging standards. This book gives the reader state-of-the-art information in today’s XML with plenty of useful technical knowledge. --Richard Dragan/',

    description: 'John C. Maxwell offers lively stories about the foibles and successes of Lee Iacocca, Abraham Lincoln, Princess Diana, and Elizabeth Dole in The 21 Irrefutable Laws of Leadership. Readers can expect a well-crafted discussion that emphasizes the core attitudes and visions of leadership. Maxwell uses the same tell-it-like-it-is approach that he honed in the bestselling Developing the Leader Within You. For instance, when explaining "The Law of Influence," Maxwell states that "job titles don’t have much value when it comes to leading. True leadership cannot be awarded, appointed or assigned. It comes only from influence and that can’t be mandated." Even after Princess Diana was stripped of her title, Maxwell says she was still able to lead a global effort toward banning land mines because of her sophisticated ability to influence others./ If readers are looking for a step-by-step formula, Maxwell’s list of "laws" will probably seem too chatty and anecdote driven. There are no specific tips on what readers can do during the next workday to help them become stronger leaders. On the other hand, Maxwell’s background as a pastor gives him an inspirational voice and a spiritual context to leadership that many business and church leaders appreciate. --Gail Hudson/',

By boiling everything down to its essential elements, they maintain, managers can ignore new fads and hot consultants and instead focus on the true business at hand. Fascinating in its own unpretentious, logical manner, The Power of Simplicity is their stripped-down guide to a future without chaos and disorder. Addressing the basics involved as well as specific management, leadership, and people issues, they hit a variety of applicable themes--including information, competitors, mission statements, goals, and motivation--using short individual chapters that quickly get to the heart of the matter with a few germane anecdotes and expert quotes followed by suggestions that are both coherent and feasible. Each begins with an inspirational epigram by the likes of Abraham Lincoln, Mark Twain, Malcolm Forbes, and even Mother Goose, and concludes with a Simple Summation, such as this one on strategy: "If you’re not different, you’d better have a lower price."--Howard Rothman',

    description: 'This book is a superb introduction to Java servlets and their various communications mechanisms. It includes deep and comprehensive coverage of the Java Servlet API, and also of HTTP, non-HTTP socket communications, Remote Method Invocation (RMI), and more. Throughout, the authors present excellent illustrative code and go to much effort to explain why things work the way they do./ The authors (to their credit) do not assume that Java programmers will be familiar with transport protocols or what really goes on when a Web server operates. They begin by showing how to use servlets to generate static pages, then show how to get servlets to generate customized documents in response to requests from the client side. That alone will satisfy many readers’ problems. However, the authors go on to tell how to track sessions with servlets, how to carry out secure transactions, how to get servlet threads to communicate with each other, and more. If it can be done with Java servlets, it’s discussed in this book. Java Servlet Programming also includes a reference to the Java Servlet API, version 2. --David Wall/',

    description: 'Coauthored by Brian Kernighan, one of the pioneers of the C programming language, The Practice of Programming is a manual of good programming style that will help any C//C++ or Java developer create faster, more maintainable code./ Early sections look at some of the pitfalls of C//C++, with numerous real-world excerpts of confusing or incorrect code. The authors offer many tips and solutions, including a guide for variable names and commenting styles. Next, they cover algorithms, such as binary and quick sorting. Here, the authors show how to take advantage of the built-in functions in standard C//C++. When it comes to data structures, such as arrays, linked lists, and trees, the authors compare the options available to C, C++, Java, and even Perl developers with a random-text-generation program (using a sophisticated Markov chain algorithm) written for each language./ Subsequent sections cover debugging tips (including how to isolate errors with debugging statements) and testing strategies (both white-box and black-box testing) for verifying the correctness of code. Final sections offer tips on creating more portable C//C++ code, with the last chapter suggesting that programmers can take advantage of interpreters (and regular expressions) to gain better control over their code. A handy appendix summarizes the dozens of tips offered throughout the book./ With its commonsense expertise and range of examples drawn from C, C++, and Java, The Practice of Programming is an excellent resource for improving the style and performance of your code base. --Richard Dragan/',

This handsomely printed book uses rich color on every page while demonstrating how you can create Java programs that will look great on any computer./ The book focuses on the built-in Java look-and-feel (called Metal). Early sections discuss the philosophy of Java user interfaces, which include excellent support for different languages and accessibility, keeping disabled users in mind./ Much of this text covers Java UI elements offering advice on creating more intuitive interfaces. Sections of the book look at the rudimentary, visual sensibilities needed for using colors and text appropriately, including how to design artwork (like icons and graphics) that fits in with the rest of the JFC interface. One example shows the step-by-step creation of a proper Java icon. Other sections propose standards for the number of pixels that should be used to separate onscreen elements. Sections on mouse, keyboard, and drag-and-drop user operations make clear how your Java programs should handle user actions./ Later this text surveys JFC components beginning with basic windows, dialog boxes, menus, and toolbars. Next it’s on to individual components from basic controls (like buttons, checkboxes, and text controls) to more advanced components (like tables and tree controls). (This section, which lists the extensive options for selecting data and resizing table columns, shows the real sophistication of today’s JFC package.)/ Though it contains no actual Java code, Java Look and Feel Guidelines defines the visual design standard for the next generation of Java programs. It will useful for anyone who builds user interfaces during the software design process. --Richard Dragan/',

    description: 'David Medinets’s principal task in PHP3: Programming Browser-Based Applications is to find common ground for a discussion of PHP3, the database-interfacing module for the Apache Web server. Unfortunately, his task is subverted by PHP3’s complexity./ In principle, PHP3’s Perl-like script slides into HTML. When accessed by a browser, the code is interpreted by the Apache server, building a Web page out of data pulled from an SQL database through Apache’s PHP3 module. The centrality of PHP3 in linking the user to the database is clear, but the stability of a uniform PHP3 implementation in an intrinsically heterogeneous Linux//Unix environment is so problematic as to be prohibitive./ To be fair, Medinets’s PHP3: Programming Browser-Based Applications is a thoughtfully constructed book, but it sends mixed signals about whether it will enter the fray of PHP3 module support. Medinets’s 20-page line-by-line description of building PHP3 begins with guidelines on how to make a new gcc compiler. Safe to ignore? Maybe not, because his Apache server-build instructions should be followed verbatim. A clean build and test on a generic Linux distribution is a multi-day effort because essential environment variables aren’t documented--neither by Medinets nor by the PHP3 development team. Dynamical loading of the PHP3 module (the modern standard for module handling) is itself a subject of strongly worded statements in the newsgroups. Medinets has no comment on this show-stopping issue./ The book consists of didactic chapters on data manipulation, regular expressions, basic object-orientation, the CGI interface, and XML, all of which get interspersed with task-oriented interludes on connecting to databases, maintaining lists, creating HTML modules, and managing concurrent access. Over 100 pages of appendices provide SQL and PHP function references and Internet resources./ But the PHP3 development team must stabilize its interfaces before any single-source tract will suffice. Until then, readers must make personal commitments to read all available documentation. For the fearless few who venture into the PHP3 backcountry, Medinets offers an errata page at www.mtolive.com//phpbook to help with orientation. Active PHP3 mailing lists (www.php3.org) contain questions and answers, which are disparaging and hyperbolic but occasionally helpful./ The PHP3 developers have an outpost with a stable platform, and Medinets is safe at the outpost, but his smoke signals are too far away and the winds too variable for him to be of much help to us yet. --Peter Leopold/',

    description: 'Creating Web sites is easy. Creating sites that truly meet the needs and expectations of the wide range of online users is quite another story. In Designing Web Usability: The Practice of Simplicity, renowned Web usability guru Jakob Nielsen shares his insightful thoughts on the subject. Packed with annotated examples of actual Web sites, this book sets out many of the design precepts all Web developers should follow./ This guide segments discussions of Web usability into page, content, site, and intranet design. This breakdown skillfully isolates for the reader many subtly different challenges that are often mixed together in other discussions. For example, Nielsen addresses the requirements of viewing pages on varying monitor sizes separately from writing concise text for "scanability." Along the way, the author pulls no punches with his opinions, using phrases like "frames: just say no" to immediately make his feelings known. Fortunately, his advise is some of the best you’ll find./ One of the unique aspects of this title is the use of actual statistics to buttress the author’s opinions on various techniques and technologies. He includes survey results on sizes of screens, types of queries submitted to search portals, response times by connection type and more. This book is intended as the first of two volumes--focusing on the "what." The author promises a follow-up title that will show the "hows" and, based on this installation, we can’t wait. --Stephen W.

    description: 'The unexpected pleasure of reading books about databases is that they are often written by authors with highly organized minds. Paul DuBois and his editors at New Riders have assembled MySQL with a clarity and lucidity that inspires confidence in the subject matter: a (nearly) freely redistributable SQL-interpreting database client//server primarily geared for Unix systems but maintained for Windows platforms as well. What isn’t "free" about MySQL (the application) is its server’s commercial use; all clients and noncommercial server use are free. DuBois’s tome isn’t free either, but its list price is modest in light of its value and the value of its namesake./ The volume is superbly organized into 12 chapters and 10 appendices and contains a concise table of contents and a comprehensive 50-page index. It is peppered with references to the online HTML documentation that comes with the source and binary distributions (which are available and easy to install in stable rpm and tar releases.)/ The first third of MySQL is an excellent instruction tool for database newbies; the second third is a detailed reference for MySQL developers; and the last third consists of clearly annotated appendices, including C, Perl (but not Python), and PHP interfaces./ Perhaps as an indication of the collective will of the developers of MySQL, DuBois does not separate Windows 95//98//NT design or development specifics from its main discussions. Platform-independent design is a goal, not a reality, and users will have to rely on newsgroups and mailing lists for details. Moreover, security issues are addressed in a mere 18 pages, a large part of which is devoted to standard Unix file and network-access permissions. Next to nothing is mentioned about defense against common hacking strategies, the use of secure shell interfaces, or access encryption./ Although it is nearly 800 pages in length, DuBois’s book is thankfully not encyclopedic. It is a valuable pr&#x00e9;cis of the MySQL database, and its easy-to-skim look and feel will make it an excellent browse for database experts who want to know what is and is not possible within MySQL, the application. --Peter Leopold/',

    description: 'PHP is getting lots of attention as an open-source alternative to Microsoft Active Server Pages, not least because it runs on Linux and other Unix-like systems as well as on Windows. It is a server-side parsing engine that lets you put dynamic content such as online databases on your Web site. The beauty of server-side processing is that any browser can view the results, provided of course that you are careful with your Web-page authoring./ Few books on PHP are available, so PHP Essentials is particularly welcome. The author is a PHP enthusiast and also uses it professionally. Her aim is to provide a hands-on guide to installing and using PHP for those who have no previous knowledge of the product. The book’s based on version 3 but covers new PHP 4 features too. Readers are expected to have a basic knowledge of HTML, though. Although databases such as SQL Server and Oracle are briefly discussed, there is a special focus on using PHP with MySQL, an excellent open-source database server. (This is a common partnership, so the focus is appropriate.)/ After tackling installation and basic PHP scripts, the book gets straight to the business of linking with a database. The text includes a short introduction to SQL and a complete example of how to create and query a database table. Further chapters cover user authentication, session management with cookies, and Web-based database administration. Finally, a complete e-commerce example in included, with code both printed in the book and available from a supporting Web site. An appendix offers a PHP language reference./ This book teaches by example. It is manageable in size and has a friendly, real-world feel. It is not the last word on the subject, though, so it’s best suited to PHP newcomers or those using rival technology who want an idea of what PHP can do. --Tim Anderson, Amazon.co.uk/',

    description: 'The book that explains why you really hate computers./ I’ve admired Jef Raskin for years. For those who don’t know, he is the "Father of the Macintosh," one of the original geniuses who guided the Mac in the early days. But, more than a computer scientist, Raskin is a cognitive psychologist. He studies how the brain works with special emphasis on how that relates to us using computers. His magnum opus was the Canon Cat, which was an excellent and well-thought-out little computer./ In The Humane Interface, Raskin goes into detail describing how computers can be made easier to understand and use. Ever want to know why you really don’t like Windows? The answer is in this book. In fact, there’s so much in this book that makes sense, I really want to send a copy to every employee at Microsoft./ I loved reading this book and nodding my head in rabid agreement. Raskin states, "There has never been any technical reason for a computer to take more than a few seconds to begin operation when it is turned on." So why then does Windows (or Linux!) take so darn long to start up? The PalmPilot is on instantly, as is your cell phone. But for some reason, we tolerate the computer taking a few eons to start. (And until consumers complain about it, things won’t change.)/ Computers can be easy to use, and the people who design them and design software need to read this book. Do you ever get the impression that the person who designed a piece of software must have come from the same company that designed the front panel on your VCR? Why should you have to double-click anything? What does Ctrl+D mean one thing in one program and a completely different thing in another? And what’s the point of the Yes//No confirmation if the user is in the habit of clicking Yes without thinking about it? Raskin neatly probes all these areas./ While I admire everything Raskin has to say, the book is pretty heavy on the psychology end. Myself, I enjoy cognitive psychology (especially books by Raskin’s cohort Donald Norman), though some may find that part of the book boring. Even so, Raskin builds and backs his argument in a most eloquent and scientific manner. Especially if you design software or need to teach or train people to use computers, this book deserves a spot on your shelf. --Dan Gookin/',

    description: 'PHP is an open-source Web scripting language that’s gaining steam in the development community, especially in the Apache Web server realm. With a syntax that draws heavily on C, PHP appeals to advanced programmers who are moving to the Web from traditional software development./ Web Application Development with PHP 4.0 isn’t your run-of-the-mill language tutorial. Authors Ratschiller and Gerken purposely designed its content to appeal to coders who already are proficient in PHP, but in need of advanced programming techniques and high-level application-development skills. Assuming a strong programming foundation, this book can be considered a next-level PHP tutorial./ Drawing on their own experience of what’s really important in PHP development, the authors dive into topics such as linked lists and associative arrays. They also weave together topics like security and database access with such software-development issues as three-tier architecture, versioning, and program requirements. This balance makes for a nice fit for developers who have mastered the basics, but are looking to hone their skills to move to the next level./ The book also goes into how to extend PHP by modifying its Zend language engine via the C source code. A companion CD includes PHP, MySQL, and Apache, as well as a number of utilities and the source code from the book. If already you’re deep into PHP and want to graduate to guru status, this book’s for you. --Stephen W. Plain/ Topics covered: Development planning, coding conventions, advanced PHP syntax, associative arrays, polymorphism and self-modifying code, application design, HTTP and sessions, PHP normal form, database access with PHP, PHP, and XML, and extending PHP Zend engine./',

    description: 'Learning to design objects effectively with Java is the goal of Beginning Java Objects: From Concepts to Code, an intensive yet approachable guide to object design, using UML and today’s hottest programming language. Plenty of titles dig into the Java language in massive detail, but this one steps back and looks at object design first. The details of Java, from basic language features to a simple tutorial for building user interfaces in Swing, emerge only after a thorough tour of thinking in objects./ The book takes readers through object design, from the very beginning, at a relaxed pace. While you get all of the necessary jargon for really learning the object paradigm (for example, there’s full coverage of such concepts as data encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism), the tutorial is likely to reach more readers. Without being doctrinaire about the design process, the author walks you through the steps for "discovering" objects in a business problem (including classes, attributes, and operations) and then determining how these objects work together to model real-world problems. The sample class diagrams offer quite a rich level of detail, and a single case study for a student course registration database demonstrates the design principles, including extensive class diagrams./ By the end of the book, this set of classes is transformed into working Java code, with a simple Swing-based user interface. Although the book cuts a few corners--such as using tab-delimited data instead of JDBC (a must for business programmers)--there’s little doubt that this lively approach to mastering Java will benefit a wide range of readers. If ever you’ve been unsure about what object-oriented design really means, Beginning Java Objects can demystify important concepts and put the power of objects within your reach. --Richard Dragan/',

    description: 'This new addition to the growing library of Flash instruction books gives readers a solid base in this popular and increasingly necessary Web development application. The book promises a foundation that’s both accessible, meaning that you won’t be daunted by ActionScript or any of the other topics, and extensible, meaning that you’ll find it easy to add to your knowledge after you’ve finished the book./ Foundation successfully avoids the trap, so common in other instruction books, of an all-encompassing but shallow overview. It successfully performs an in-depth treatment of the more essential aspects of using Flash. At the end, you might not know every menu option, but you’ll be able to construct your own Flash Web site. The book uses one case study project: a Web site interface with animated buttons, soundtrack, and Flash-enabled content. Small-scale lessons within chapters and application of these lessons to the larger-scale project help reinforce the material (support files for the case study can be downloaded from www.friendsofed.com)./ The writing follows a narrative style (longer paragraphs both before and within the numbered steps), and manages to be just the right amounts of casual and friendly. Personal anecdotes, when they occur, actually enhance the lessons. Although this style makes hopping around the book and troubleshooting specific problems more difficult, the payoff for reading in a linear, cumulative fashion is a better handle on the pros and cons of Flash’s core features. Another plus is that readers can follow along, even if they’re not sitting at the computer. (Learn Flash on the subway! Why not?) Throughout the book, the authors often point out alternative methods and uses for features, too, which encourages creative thinking on how to apply the lessons to your own projects. First-time users of Flash, as well as experienced users who have put off trying scripting, will find this book a good place to start. --Angelynn Grant/ Topics covered:&#x2028;Step-by-step instruction of Flash 5, using a Web site interface case study.

    description: 'Charles Petzold’s latest book, Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software, crosses over into general-interest nonfiction from his usual programming genre. It’s a carefully written, carefully researched gem that will appeal to anyone who wants to understand computer technology at its essence. Readers learn about number systems (decimal, octal, binary, and all that) through Petzold’s patient (and frequently entertaining) prose and then discover the logical systems that are used to process them. There’s loads of historical information too. From Louis Braille’s development of his eponymous raised-dot code to Intel Corporation’s release of its early microprocessors, Petzold presents stories of people trying to communicate with (and by means of) mechanical and electrical devices. It’s a fascinating progression of technologies, and Petzold presents a clear statement of how they fit together./ The real value of Code is in its explanation of technologies that have been obscured for years behind fancy user interfaces and programming environments, which, in the name of rapid application development, insulate the programmer from the machine. In a section on machine language, Petzold dissects the instruction sets of the genre-defining Intel 8080 and Motorola 6800 processors. He walks the reader through the process of performing various operations with each chip, explaining which opcodes poke which values into which registers along the way. Petzold knows that the hidden language of computers exhibits real beauty. In Code, he helps readers appreciate it. --David Wall/ Topics covered: Mechanical and electrical representations of words and numbers, number systems, logic gates, performing mathematical operations with logic gates, microprocessors, machine code, memory and programming languages./',

    description: 'Usability design is one of the most important--yet often least attractive--tasks for a Web developer. In Don’t Make Me Think, author Steve Krug lightens up the subject with good humor and excellent, to-the-point examples./ The title of the book is its chief personal design premise. All of the tips, techniques, and examples presented revolve around users being able to surf merrily through a well-designed site with minimal cognitive strain. Readers will quickly come to agree with many of the book’s assumptions, such as "We don’t read pages--we scan them" and "We don’t figure out how things work--we muddle through." Coming to grips with such hard facts sets the stage for Web design that then produces topnotch sites./ Using an attractive mix of full-color screen shots, cute cartoons and diagrams, and informative sidebars, the book keeps your attention and drives home some crucial points. Much of the content is devoted to proper use of conventions and content layout, and the "before and after" examples are superb. Topics such as the wise use of rollovers and usability testing are covered using a consistently practical approach./ This is the type of book you can blow through in a couple of evenings. But despite its conciseness, it will give you an expert’s ability to judge Web design. You’ll never form a first impression of a site in the same way again. --Stephen W. Plain/ Topics covered:/',

    description: 'If you just stumbled into design, maybe via a hobby that grew into a career, and you want to improve your work without having to enroll in a degree program, this book can bridge some of the gaps in your acumen. Not really a primer on basic facts, Design Workshop is more like a guide to style./ The first chapter quizzes readers on mostly technical, basic details of design (like dpi), all of which can be found in Williams’s previous publications (for example, The Non-Designer’s Design Book). Readers will be dismayed, possibly annoyed, that the quiz answers are not provided. Even if not knowing the answers means that you need remedial help, it feels like a bit of a tease./ The next chapters show how to use stock images, or your own images, to increase the visual impact of your piece (basically through an increase in contrast). The best part of this section, and the book as a whole, is the "before-and-after" approach in the examples; they’re like a series of makeovers. The captions effectively describe what was changed in the image, and how it improved the design./ The book applies a similar set of makeovers to various types of design projects: logos, forms, newsletters, tables of contents, etc. In the final section, seven designers, including coauthor Tollett, break down the process that they went through on a job of their own./ Self-taught graphic designers probably would make the best audience for this book, but designers who are of their own "school of thought" might find fault with some of the tenets that are put forth. Graphic design by nature is a subjective enterprise--at the mercy of "styles." What you get in this book is more of a "desktop-publisher style" (many of the drawings are clip art, for example). There’s a lack of sophistication in the design of the book, as well as in the illustrations of posters, letterheads, advertisements, and other applications that are used as examples. On the other hand, this same open, naive look gives the book an inviting appeal, and makes it perhaps a bit less daunting than style guides, such as Robert Bringhurst’s The Elements of Typographic Style, that are intended for die-hard professionals. --Angelynn Grant/ Topics covered:/ Style advice for design projects, including:/ /',

This CD covers the underlying principles of animation and how to add them to your Flash work. Chris begins with the simplest principles of animation like speed, timing, squash and stretch, anticipation, bounce, and gravity, then progresses into the analysis of physical effects and natural phenomena. Examples of Flash animation are broken down into single frames revealing what it takes to create realistic motion for sparks, drips, water, lightning, and explosions. "Straight ahead" drawing is explained and demonstrated, and some of Chris’s "visual music" pieces are shown.',

    description: 'In this thoughtful book, usability expert John Cato outlines a design process that has a Web site visitor’s needs in mind. He offers both theoretical discussions and real-world case studies. Although the illustrations in this compact book are small and not always well printed, the insightful advice is clearly communicated and is valuable to anyone setting out on the open sea of Web development. And, with its analyses of various corporate Web sites (including this one at Amazon.com), User-Centered Web Design addresses particularly important issues for those involved with e-business. This is neither a software how-to book nor a showcase of what’s cutting-edge on the Web today. But it does inspire the sort of careful thinking found in Don Norman’s The Psychology of Everyday Things./ Throughout the book, Cato offers diagrams, paradigms, and to-do lists, the first being his looping description of one’s relation to the world: Awareness - Understanding - Action. His model for designing is Discover - Design - Use. Discovery includes the vision, exploration, "the ‘Ah ha’ moment." Design is where it is all born, and Use involves market testing and verification. These are just a few of the theoretical game plans he offers. Cato uses case studies to show how one can make user profiles contribute to the design process. It feels very similar to learning good marketing skills in business school./ The book also takes a careful look at visual techniques used on many sites today, breaking down what works and what doesn’t, even proposing alternatives. For example, is the user confused over whether something is a button? Cato writes, "Make it buttony, and employ mouseovers to give confirmatory feedback," and "Go for creative ways of grabbing attention; they do not have to be large things."/ You’ll also learn how to push your creativity, get over your fears, and believe in yourself (good all-around life advice). There’s even a section that looks at design issues for Web-enabled cell phones. This book won’t wow you with its visuals, but the ideas and inspiration within may help you wow others with your Web design. --Angelynn Grant/',

Web Redesign: Workflow That Works directly addresses this crucial area with a specific, proven process./ This brief but important book lays out a specific five-step strategy--called the Core Process--that can always be applied to the development of Web sites and fine-tuned to almost any type of project. Each step--defining the project, developing site structure, visual design and testing, production and QA, and launch and beyond--contains three related but distinct tracks. The text begins with a brief overview of each of the steps, then delves deeper into each with detailed explanations as well as specific forms and project-management strategies. This book does not cover back-end, server-side programming. Instead, it focuses primarily on the visual, conventional components of a Web site./ Authors Kelly Goto and Emily Cotler compiled this book in an attractive, easy-to-read format. This process guide uses numerous full-color screen shots to illustrate site examples, as well as plenty of site diagrams and sample forms. The book even has a companion Web site with downloadable forms in PDF format to put the Core Process into immediate action. --Stephen W. Plain/ Topics covered:/',

    description: 'One of the best tutorials available for designers and nonprogrammers, Foundation ActionScript is perhaps one of the finest introductory programming books ever written--but programmers and Flash experts will be bored stiff by the baby-step teaching methods this book exhibits./ The book assumes the you have no knowledge of programming concepts going in, and introduces the basics using simple, real-world examples to show you that programming is nothing more than breaking down what you want to do into the smallest elements. Author Sham Bhangal takes the example of making tea and sections it out into its composite elements. Then, he writes a pseudoprogram that makes tea, using very clear, accessible, and, above all, comforting language. If you’ve always been nervous about the seemingly scary idea of "programming," then Foundation ActionScript will reassure you./ Bhangal then brings this idea of simplicity into ActionScript programming, at first showing you how to accomplish simple tasks--like stopping a ball from zipping across the screen--and then gradually turning up the heat as he begins to probe ActionScript’s more advanced functions./ The key word here is "gradually," since fundamental programming ideas like variables aren’t even mentioned until chapter 6. This gradual process works marvelously in some ways, since Bhangal goes over each topic so thoroughly and exhaustively that you never lose track of what you’re learning--and the repetitiveness pays off not only in spades, but also in hearts, clubs, and diamonds./ Suffice it to say that when I started to write this review, I originally said that the book didn’t really do anything all that complex because the most complex project was a full-fledged Space Invaders-style game, complete with object-oriented programming, sprite manipulation, and reusable code. Only in retrospect did it occur to me that this involved some fairly heavy-duty tweaking for a beginner--but Foundation ActionScript makes it all seem so easy that programming a video game, albeit a simple one, seemed a trivial thing to do./ Still, there are some definite problems. For one thing, if you are a programmer or understand these concepts, the glacial pace at which the book retreads familiar (to you, at least) ground will be maddening. For another thing, it’s very nice to program video games, but one of the things that this book lacks is examples from real-world Web pages. A lot of the examples can be used in real Web sites, but there are also a lot of throwaway examples that are simply used as teaching tools--things like little games, the inputting of passwords, overly-simple bouncing ball loops, and so on. Although this focus provides a lot of basic programming skills, it doesn’t really give designers the methodology they need to translate grand topics into simple mathematics. It might have been nice for the book to take some really cool effects from live sites and then deconstruct them to show you how they work, thus giving you the tools you need./ But if you’re a novice, there really is nothing better available to teach you Flash scripting and what you use it for. It’s easy, it’s informative, and it’s even a darn fun read--by computer book standards, that is. Highly recommended. --William Steinmetz/',

    description: 'While there is a plethora of books available that provide tips on Web design, most authors leave a significant gap between the theory and practice--a gap that is left up to the reader to fill. Homepage Usability: 50 Websites Deconstructed boldly steps into that gap with specific observations and suggestions backed with solid quantitative analysis. This book focuses only on home page design as the most important point of presence for any Web site./ This definitive work is coauthored by Jakob Nielsen--the accepted industry expert in Web usability--and Marie Tahir, an expert in user profiling. Their collaboration has produced a guide of such rare practical benefit that Web designers will likely wear out their first copy scouring the pages to savor every last morsel of wisdom./ The book begins with a chapter of precise guidelines that serve as a checklist of the features and functionality to include on your home page. The specifics found in categories such as "revealing content through examples" and "graphic design" will quickly hook you and whet your appetite for more. These guidelines are followed up with hard statistics and an examination of the ominous Jakob’s Law: "Users spend most of their time on other sites than your site." Here you’ll find some interesting statistics about how various conventions like search, privacy policies, and logos are used./ All this leads up to the showcase element of the book--a systematic deconstruction of 50 of the most popular home pages on the Web. The authors painstakingly pick apart each in an uncompromising autopsy of usability. Each site is graphically analyzed for its use of real estate and summarized with the frankness only found from true experts. Then each section of the home page is bulleted and analyzed for potential improvements./ It’s a bold move to offer a critique of industry-standard Web sites such as Yahoo, CNET, and eBay, but the authors have done such a fine job that the designers of those sites will surely make reading this book a high priority. For the rest of us, this work will serve as an invaluable gospel. --Stephen W.

Web writing needs to be straightforward ("the enigmatic, provocative, cryptic, poetic, ironic, or witty heading is wasted on the Web," she confides) but not bland. To instill trust in the reader, it must be both personal and professional. McAlpine, a trainer and consultant in online content, addresses everything here from alt-text and source code to doorway pages and link popularity. She discusses the differences between writing for the Web and writing for intranets (private Internet systems used by large organizations). She warns against long domain names, italics, and flags as language indicators. And she devotes a considerable amount of space to the fine art of customizing pages of your Web site for specific search engines. After all, who cares how brilliant your site is, if no one can find it? --Jane Steinberg',

In Love Is the Killer App he explains why. Sander’s advice is to be a "lovecat," which despite the cutesy moniker is his sincere and surprisingly practical prescription for advancement both inside and outside the office. It starts with amassing as much usable knowledge as possible, which he explains can be done by religiously carving out time to read and then poring through as many cutting-edge books in your field as possible. It follows with an emphasis on networking to the extreme. Sanders offers concrete suggestions, from compiling a super list of contacts to ensuring all are regularly stored in an always-accessible format. And he concludes by advocating a true mindset of compassion, which he says involves sharing this knowledge with those contacts and ultimately helping anyone who in one way or another may ultimately help you. Through identifiable anecdotes and specific recommendations, the book promotes an undeniably feasible yet decidedly offbeat program that has worked for the author and could prove equally favorable for others who apply it. --Howard Rothman',

    description: 'Updated to cover Flash MX, the newest version of Macromedia Flash, ActionScript for Flash MX: The Definitive Guide, Second Edition is the one book no serious Flash developer should be without./ ActionScript is Macromedia’s programming language for Flash MX, the popular authoring tool for creating rich internet applications and animations for the Web. With Macromedia’s new focus on application development, ActionScript now includes a direct drawing API, loading of external MP3 and JPG files, improved sound control, an extensive set of text formatting tools, complete support for component development using movie clip subclasses, local data storage, accessibility features, and much more. And ActionScript for Flash MX: The Definitive Guide is the most complete, up-to-date reference available for the latest version of this language./ Author Colin Moock, one of the most universally respected developers in the Flash community, has added hundreds of new code examples to show new Flash MX techniques in the real world: how to draw circles, save data to disk, convert arrays to onscreen tables, create reusable components, and preload variables, XML, and sounds. The book’s language reference alone has nearly doubled from the first edition, with more than 250 new classes, objects, methods, and properties. You’ll find exhaustive coverage of dozens of undocumented, under-documented, and mis-documented features./ Along with the new material, Colin Moock has meticulously revised the entire text to conform to Flash MX best-coding practices. In particular, objected-oriented programming and the new event model get special attention in light of changes to Flash MX ActionScript. From sending data between two movies to creating getter//setter properties, the new edition of this book demystifies the often-confusing new features of Flash MX, giving developers easy access to its powerful new capabilities./ ActionScript for Flash MX: The Definitive Guide is structured so non-programmers can learn how to use ActionScript and programmers can take their skills to new heights. If you are in the market to really learn about the hows and whys of ActionScript, then this is the book for you./',

    description: 'Standards, argues Jeffrey Zeldman in Designing With Web Standards, are our only hope for breaking out of the endless cycle of testing that plagues designers hoping to support all possible clients. In this book, he explains how designers can best use standards--primarily XHTML and CSS, plus ECMAScript and the standard Document Object Model (DOM)--to increase their personal productivity and maximize the availability of their creations. Zeldman’s approach is detailed, authoritative, and rich with historical context, as he is quick to explain how features of standards evolved. It’s a fantastic education that any design professional will appreciate./ Zeldman is an idealist who devotes some of his book to explaining how much easier life would be if browser developers would just support standards properly (he’s done a lot toward this goal in real life, as well). He is also a pragmatist, who recognizes that browsers implement standards differently (or partially, or not at all) and that it is the job of the Web designer to make pages work anyway. Thus, his book includes lots of explicit and tightly focused tips (with code) that have to do with bamboozling non-compliant browsers into behaving as they should, without tripping up more compliant browsers. There’s lots of coverage of design and testing tools that can aid in the creation of good-looking, standards-abiding documents. --David Wall/ Topics covered: Why Web standards (such as XHTML, CSS, ECMAScript, and DOM) are good for everyone, and why site designers and browser makers should move towards standards compliance./',

    description: 'In his debut story collection, You Are Not a Stranger Here, Adam Haslett drags into the light subjects often left in the cellar. Most of his stories are told from the viewpoint of the mentally ill (though one, "The Good Doctor," shows us madness from a caregiver’s perspective). The rest of the stories deal with closeted homosexuality: boys who are just learning their identity, men who have never come to terms with it. Haslett is an enormously compassionate writer, and shows a lovely, plain-written acuity about his people. His writing is a convincing inside job--he never romanticizes or oversimplifies. In "The Volunteer," an old woman at a care facility is haunted by the voice of an ancestress named Hester: "For more than two decades, Elizabeth Maynard has done exactly as she is told and the voice of Hester, which has cost her so much, comes only quietly and intermittently. It is a negative sort of achievement, she thinks, to have spent a life warding something off."/ Haslett has a gift for writing quietly about sensational topics: men cruising each other in the park at night; an abusive, self-hating relationship between two adolescent boys. The stories can get a bit too fancy: the writer can’t resist the ironic twist or the surprise ending. Still, this is a beautifully written collection that’s as heartfelt as it is intelligent. --Claire Dederer/',

    description: 'At its core, Amazon.com is a great big database concerned with lots of stuff--books, of course, but also tools, clothing, films on DVD, kitchen equipment, and lots and lots (and lots) of Harry Potter paraphernalia. Want to wear an Anna Kournikova exercise brassiere while juicing celery (presumably with considerable vigor)? Amazon can help. Need a cricket bat, radar gun, dietary fiber supplement, or vibrasonic molechaser? Amazon has what you need. Which is all great, but the real value of Amazon.com isn’t that these things are in the database. The real value of this site lies in the information about all that stuff--reviews, sales rankings, recommendations, and the like--and the large number of ways to access it. Amazon Hacks explains how to get the most out of Amazon.com as an ordinary customer with a Web browser and as a software developer interested in the site’s considerable collection of Web Services./ In Amazon Hacks, Paul Bausch documents most of the avenues Amazon.com has opened up for exploration of the database. A lot of his coverage borders on the obvious: Sections on how to "Power-Search for Books" and "Put an Item Up for Bid at Amazon Auctions" aren’t too different from Amazon’s own explanatory articles. Coverage of how to add an Amazon search box to your own site, and add Amazon Associates item links to various kinds of Weblogs (including Blosxom and Moveable Type) are much handier. Bausch really shines when explaining Amazon.com’s Web Services (AWS), the remotely accessible software interfaces that enables programs to search the database. He includes AWS-enabled programs in PHP, Python, and Perl. --David Wall/ Topics covered: How to use Amazon.com as a Web surfer, Web site publisher, and software developer.

    description: 'With first-chapter allusions to martial arts, "flow,""mind like water," and other concepts borrowed from the East (and usually mangled), you’d almost think this self-helper from David Allen should have been called Zen and the Art of Schedule Maintenance./ Not quite. Yes, Getting Things Done offers a complete system for downloading all those free-floating gotta-do’s clogging your brain into a sophisticated framework of files and action lists--all purportedly to free your mind to focus on whatever you’re working on. However, it still operates from the decidedly Western notion that if we could just get really, really organized, we could turn ourselves into 24//7 productivity machines. (To wit, Allen, whom the New Economy bible Fast Company has dubbed "the personal productivity guru," suggests that instead of meditating on crouching tigers and hidden dragons while you wait for a plane, you should unsheathe that high-tech saber known as the cell phone and attack that list of calls you need to return.)/ As whole-life-organizing systems go, Allen’s is pretty good, even fun and therapeutic. It starts with the exhortation to take every unaccounted-for scrap of paper in your workstation that you can’t junk, The next step is to write down every unaccounted-for gotta-do cramming your head onto its own scrap of paper. Finally, throw the whole stew into a giant "in-basket"/ That’s where the processing and prioritizing begin; in Allen’s system, it get a little convoluted at times, rife as it is with fancy terms, subterms, and sub-subterms for even the simplest concepts. Thank goodness the spine of his system is captured on a straightforward, one-page flowchart that you can pin over your desk and repeatedly consult without having to refer back to the book. That alone is worth the purchase price. Also of value is Allen’s ingenious Two-Minute Rule: if there’s anything you absolutely must do that you can do right now in two minutes or less, then do it now, thus freeing up your time and mind tenfold over the long term. It’s commonsense advice so obvious that most of us completely overlook it, much to our detriment; Allen excels at dispensing such wisdom in this useful, if somewhat belabored, self-improver aimed at everyone from CEOs to soccer moms (who we all know are more organized than most CEOs to start with). --Timothy Murphy/',

Innovation is cheaper than advertising, advises Godin who defines the "free prize" with diverse examples including swatch watches, frequent flyer miles, dog bakeries, Tupperware parties and portable shredding trucks. He explains "Design matters, style matters, extras matter."/ The largest portion of the book is devoted to how to sell an idea to your organization. His specific tactics range from irreverent, (let them pee on your ideas) to practical (how to build a prototype). One standout chapter explains how brainstorming can become boring. His alternative, "edgecraft," involves divergent thinking to add something remarkable to your product. His long grocery list of edges (safety, equality, invisibility, and hours of operation) suggest a genuine marketing manifesto. The ideas are bold and insightful, but can suffer from being presented in less than logical order. The book is also diminished by Godin’s self-marketing, from using terminology in his previous books to naming key ideas after himself. These advertisements are unnecessary. This nervy little volume is bound to mother many inventions. --Barbara Mackoff/',

    description: 'Every marketer tells a story. And if they do it right, we believe them. We believe that wine tastes better in a $20 glass than a $1 glass. We believe that an $80,000 Porsche Cayenne is vastly superior to a $36,000 VW Touareg, which is virtually the same car. We believe that $225 Pumas will make our feet feel better-and look cooler-than $20 no-names . . . and believing it makes it true./ Successful marketers don’t talk about features or even benefits. Instead, they tell a story. A story we want to believe./ This is a book about doing what consumers demand-painting vivid pictures that they choose to believe. Every organization-from nonprofits to car companies, from political campaigns to wineglass blowers-must understand that the rules have changed (again). In an economy where the richest have an infinite number of choices (and no time to make them), every organization is a marketer and all marketing is about telling stories./ Marketers succeed when they tell us a story that fits our worldview, a story that we intuitively embrace and then share with our friends. Think of the Dyson vacuum cleaner or the iPod./ But beware: If your stories are inauthentic, you cross the line from fib to fraud. Marketers fail when they are selfish and scurrilous, when they abuse the tools of their trade and make the world worse. That’s a lesson learned the hard way by telemarketers and Marlboro./ This is a powerful book for anyone who wants to create things people truly want as opposed to commodities that people merely need./',

    description: 'In her debut novel Bling, Erica Kennedy exposes the dark underside of the hip-hop recording industry in the same way The Nanny Diaries outed the Park Avenue elite. Kennedy charts the course of Mimi, a small-town girl from Ohio who is discovered by Lamont Jackson, a hip-hop mogul who discards of gym clothing after one use and sends potential bedmates to his personal physician for a full work-up before hitting the sheets. Secondary characters like Lena Whitaker, the spoiled daughter of an LA lawyer who unknowingly foots the bill for trinkets like a $15,000 diamond necklace for Crazy G, Lena’s booty call of the month, and Lamont’s cocaine-snorting, Gucci-wearing, sister-in-law Vanessa de la Cruz, quickly become Mimi’s image and social consultants. Rounding out the crew are a host of rappers who work for Lamont, including Ernesto, aka Phat E, a bear of a man who "raps about his slick girl-getting abilities" yet goes home every night to his high-school sweetheart Renee, who "was proud to walk the halls with Ernesto even though he had ballooned to 280 pounds by senior prom."/ Bling takes readers on an insider’s tour of the world of parties in the Hamptons, VIP lounges, fashion shows, and Tribeca penthouses. In fact, the tour is so intimate that many readers will recognize thinly veiled faces along the way, like Ally C., the blond-haired, blue-eyed publicist from Long Island, and Irv Greene, the aging music executive from Brooklyn. Kennedy leaves no stone unturned; there’s even a prepubescent rapper aptly named Billy Tha Kid. All these details make for a very long book, and by the end, readers may find themselves skimming the pages to find out what eventually happens. Still, for anyone who has ever wondered what goes through the minds of P. Diddy and his entourage as they emerge from the Escalade, Bling promises to enthrall and entertain. --Gisele Toueg/',

Each chapter starts out with an example of what Dan refers to as an &#x201c;unbulletproof&#x201d; concept&#x2014;an existing site that employs a traditional approach and its associated pitfalls. Dan then deconstructs that approach, noting its downsides and then making the site over using Cascading Style Sheets (CSS).
