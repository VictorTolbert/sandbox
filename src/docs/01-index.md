...includes the resources to create user interfaces consistent with the Videa design principles, design language, and best practices. Rather than focusing on pixels, developers can focus on application logic, while designers can focus on user experience, interactions, and flows.

This site provides a range of resources for designers and developers, which includes:

- semantic and accessible component markup.
- cross-browser compatible CSS.
- icons, font, and design guidelines.
